some more info, for implementation of the model,
the y_1 is visit_doctor
y_2 is pharma_use
y_3 is health

the variables to include in x_1 are
gender income income2 public_sub private_sub age age2  schooling north center alentejo algarve acores madeira
but to get it working start with gender income and age only

the variables to include in x_2 are
gender income age age2  schooling diabetes ashtma high_blood_p reumat pain ostheo retina glauco cancer kidney_stone
renal anxiety enphisema stroke obese depression heart_attack public_sub private_sub private_insurance  age_gender north center alentejo algarve acores madeira
to start use only gender age income schooling

the variables to include in x_3 are
gender income public_sub private_sub age age2  schooling diabetes ashtma high_blood_p reumat pain ostheo retina glauco cancer"
 kidney_stone renal anxiety enphisema stroke obese depression heart_attack light_smoker no_smoker wine_days single married widow north center alentejo algarve acores madeira

as in the other 2 cases use only
gender income age public_sub private_sub

Take only 10% of observations to test routines - the main issue will the time of computing the expectation for the probability at each observation, so the number of observations is the key element to get it fast.
It may also help first optimizing with respect to the alpha's and beta's (the parameters on the mean effects) holding constant the ones on
variance-covariance matrix, them fixing the alpha's and beta's optimize with respect to the v-cov matrix,
