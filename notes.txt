I am sending attached the file with a note on the estimation procedure we would like you to code (in whatever programming language you prefer).
This is for maximum likelihood estimation, and I am collecting the data in a single file with only the data required for estimation.
Basically, we have a system of equations with qualitative dependent variables and recursive.
The first variable (and equation) is 0/1 for going to a doctor, the second variable is 0/1 for taking pharmaceutical products and is dependent on going to the doctor;
the third variable is health status in 1 to 5 scale, which depends on both previous variables. All these depend as well on other factors (variables).

We want to obtain the parameters of these equations. To do it, we need to have a maximum likelihood function to be the maximized on parameters, and this is what
my colleague Alberto Holly has derived in the note I am sending.
